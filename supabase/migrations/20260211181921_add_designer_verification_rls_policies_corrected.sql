/*
  # Add RLS Policies for Designer Verification System
  
  1. Purpose
    - Block pending/rejected designers from accessing the platform
    - Only allow verified designers to view and manage projects, quotes, etc.
    - Allow admins to view and manage all designer verification statuses
    
  2. Policies
    - Designers can only read their own profile (any status)
    - Only verified designers can access projects, quotes, subscriptions
    - Admins can update verification_status
    - Designers cannot change their own verification_status
    
  3. Security
    - Pending designers can still view their profile to see their status
    - But they cannot access any other platform features
