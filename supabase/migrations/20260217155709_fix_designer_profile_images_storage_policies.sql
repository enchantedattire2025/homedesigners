/*
  # Fix Designer Profile Images Storage Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create simpler policies that allow authenticated users to upload to their own folder
    - Ensure newly registered users can upload during registration process
  
  2. Security
    - Authenticated users can upload/update/delete files in their own folder (user_id)
    - Public read access for all profile images
