/*
  # Prevent Customer Edits After Quote Acceptance
  
  1. Changes
    - Add RLS policy to prevent customers from updating projects after quote is accepted
    - Creates a helper function to check if a project has an accepted quote
    - Updates existing customer update policies
  
  2. Business Logic
    - Once a customer accepts a quote, they cannot edit the project details
    - This prevents scope creep and maintains the integrity of the quoted work
    - Designers can still update project status and add updates
  
  3. Security
    - Policy ensures data integrity
    - Prevents unauthorized modifications after commitment
