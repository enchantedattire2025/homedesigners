  # Allow Designers to Update Assigned Project Status

  1. Changes
    - Add RLS policy to allow designers to update `assignment_status` and `last_modified_by` 
      fields for projects assigned to them
    - This policy specifically allows UPDATE operations where the designer is the assigned_designer_id
    
  2. Security
    - Policy only allows designers to update their own assigned projects
    - Designers can only update specific fields: assignment_status and last_modified_by
    - Uses USING clause to verify the designer is assigned to the project
    - Uses WITH CHECK to ensure the assignment doesn't change during update
