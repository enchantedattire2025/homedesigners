  # Create 3D Wallpapers Management System

  1. New Tables
    - `wallpapers_3d`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `title` (text) - Name of the wallpaper design
      - `description` (text, nullable) - Description of the wallpaper
      - `image_url` (text) - URL to the wallpaper image
      - `category` (text) - Category (Geometric, Nature, Luxury, etc.)
      - `is_active` (boolean) - Whether the wallpaper is visible in gallery
      - `created_by` (uuid) - Admin user who uploaded it
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Storage
    - Create `wallpaper-images` storage bucket for wallpaper uploads
    - Public access for reading images
    - Authenticated admin access for uploads

  3. Security
    - Enable RLS on `wallpapers_3d` table
    - Allow public read access for active wallpapers
    - Allow admin insert, update, delete
    
  4. Categories
    - Predefined categories: Geometric, Nature, Luxury, Modern, Floral, Industrial, Texture, Abstract, Wood, Zen, Space, Urban
