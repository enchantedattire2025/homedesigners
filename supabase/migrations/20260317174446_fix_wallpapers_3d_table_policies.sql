  # Fix Wallpapers 3D Table RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Update RLS policies for wallpapers_3d table to use correct column
    - Change from `admin_users.id` to `admin_users.user_id` to match auth.uid()
    
  2. Security
    - Maintains admin-only access for insert, update, and delete
    - Keeps public read access for active wallpapers
    - Admin read access for all wallpapers
    
  3. Issue Fixed
    - Ensures admin users can perform all operations on wallpapers_3d table
