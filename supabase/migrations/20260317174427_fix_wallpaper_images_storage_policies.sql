  # Fix Wallpaper Images Storage Policies

  1. Changes
    - Update storage policies for wallpaper-images bucket to use correct column
    - Change from `admin_users.id` to `admin_users.user_id` to match auth.uid()
    
  2. Security
    - Maintains admin-only access for uploads, updates, and deletes
    - Keeps public read access for viewing images
    
  3. Issue Fixed
    - Resolves "new row violates row-level security policy" error
    - Admin users can now upload wallpaper images successfully
