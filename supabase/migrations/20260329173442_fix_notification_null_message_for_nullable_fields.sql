/*
  # Fix Notification Triggers for Nullable Project Fields
  
  ## Summary
  Since project-related fields in customers table are now nullable (for wallpaper orders),
  we need to handle cases where these fields might be null to prevent notification errors.
  
  ## Changes
  - Update notify_on_project_creation to only fire when project_name is provided
  - Update notify_on_quote_request to handle nullable fields
  - Update notify_on_project_status_update to handle nullable fields
  
  ## Notes
  - Customer records without project_name are for wallpaper orders, not projects
  - Notifications should only be created for actual project registrations

Your project "' || NEW.project_name || '" has been successfully created on The Home Designers platform.

Project Details:
- Project Type: ' || COALESCE(NEW.property_type, 'Not specified') || '
- Budget Range: ' || COALESCE(NEW.budget_range, 'Not specified') || '

Next Steps:
1. Browse our verified designers
2. Request quotes from designers that match your requirements
3. Review and compare quotations
