  # Create Project Images Gallery System

  1. New Tables
    - `project_images`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `project_id` (uuid, foreign key to customers table)
      - `image_url` (text) - URL to the uploaded project image
      - `caption` (text, nullable) - Optional caption for the image
      - `is_primary` (boolean) - Whether this is the primary gallery image
      - `display_order` (integer) - Order in which images should be displayed
      - `uploaded_by` (uuid) - Designer who uploaded it
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Storage
    - Create `project-gallery` storage bucket for project completion images
    - Public read access
    - Designer upload access for their assigned projects

  3. Security
    - Enable RLS on `project_images` table
    - Public can view images for completed projects
    - Designers can upload images for their assigned completed projects
    - Designers can update/delete their uploaded images

  4. Features
    - Multiple images per project
    - Primary image selection for gallery thumbnail
    - Display order for image carousel
    - Designers upload images when project status is completed
