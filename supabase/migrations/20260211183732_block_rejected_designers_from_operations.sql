/*
  # Block Rejected Designers from All Operations
  
  1. Purpose
    - Ensure rejected designers cannot perform any operations (quotes, projects, etc.)
    - Only verified designers can access and manage platform features
    - Pending designers are also restricted (they can only view their profile)
  
  2. Changes
    - Update all designer-related RLS policies to check for 'verified' status
    - Restrict access to quotes, projects, subscriptions for non-verified designers
    
  3. Security
    - Rejected/pending designers can only view their own profile
    - No other operations are allowed until admin approves
