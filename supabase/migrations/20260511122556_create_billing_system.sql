  # Create Billing System

  1. New Tables
    - `project_bills`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `project_id` (uuid, FK to customers.id) - the project this bill belongs to
      - `quote_id` (uuid, FK to designer_quotes.id) - the accepted quote this bill was generated from
      - `designer_id` (uuid, FK to designers.id) - the designer who manages this bill
      - `bill_number` (text, unique) - auto-generated bill number
      - `subtotal` (numeric) - sum of all item amounts
      - `discount_amount` (numeric) - overall discount
      - `tax_rate` (numeric) - tax percentage
      - `tax_amount` (numeric) - calculated tax
      - `total_amount` (numeric) - final total
      - `status` (text) - 'draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'partially_paid'
      - `notes` (text) - designer notes
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz)

    - `bill_items`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `bill_id` (uuid, FK to project_bills.id)
      - `item_type` (text) - material, labor, service, component, other
      - `name` (text) - item name
      - `description` (text)
      - `number_of_units` (numeric) - count of items
      - `quantity` (numeric) - total area or units
      - `unit` (text) - sq.ft, hours, piece, etc.
      - `unit_price` (numeric) - price per unit
      - `discount_percent` (numeric) - item-level discount
      - `amount` (numeric) - calculated total for this item
      - `length` (numeric) - for area calculations
      - `breadth` (numeric) - for area calculations
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on both tables
    - Designers can manage bills for their assigned projects
    - Customers can view bills for their own projects

  3. Trigger
    - Auto-copy quotation items to billing when a quote is accepted
