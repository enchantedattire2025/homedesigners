/*
  # Fix Notification Logic - Send to Opposite Party Only

  1. Changes
    - Update triggers to send notifications only to the opposite party
    - Customer actions notify designer only
    - Designer actions notify customer only
    - Remove duplicate notifications
    
  2. Fixes
    - Quote request: Only notify designer (not customer)
    - Quotation submitted: Only notify customer (not designer)
    - Quotation accepted: Only notify designer (not customer)
    - Project status update: Only notify customer when designer updates
