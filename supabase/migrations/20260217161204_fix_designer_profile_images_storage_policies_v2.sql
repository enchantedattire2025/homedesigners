/*
  # Fix Designer Profile Images Storage Policies v2

  1. Changes
    - Drop policies using subquery-based split_part which fails in RLS context
    - Replace with simple authenticated-user policies for the designer-profiles bucket
    - The bucket already has file_size_limit and allowed_mime_types enforced at storage level
  
  2. Security
    - Only authenticated users can upload/update/delete
    - Public read access for displaying images
    - Application code controls folder structure (user_id/profile.ext)
