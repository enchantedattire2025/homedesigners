  ## Overview
  Creates a storage bucket to store quotation files and payment receipts securely.

  ## Changes
  
  1. New Storage Bucket
    - `quotation-attachments` - bucket for storing quotation PDFs and payment receipts
  
  2. Security Policies
    - Designers can upload quotation files for their own quotes
    - Customers can upload payment receipts for quotes on their projects
    - Both parties can view their respective files
    - Files are organized by quote ID for easy management
  
  ## Notes
  - Files are stored with path: {quote_id}/{file_type}/{filename}
  - Supports PDF, image formats (JPG, PNG), and common document formats
