  # Fix Site Settings RLS for Admin Read Access
  
  1. Issue
    - Current SELECT policy only allows viewing settings where is_active = true
    - When admin disables subscription management, they can't read it on refresh
    - This causes the toggle to always appear as disabled after refresh
    
  2. Solution
    - Add a new SELECT policy for admin users to view ALL site settings
    - This allows admins to read settings regardless of is_active status
    
  3. Security
    - Only authenticated admin users can read all settings
    - Public users can still only see active settings

      AND admin_users.is_active = true
    )
