/*
  # Create project_designs table for 3D design files

  1. New Tables
    - `project_designs`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `project_id` (uuid, foreign key to customers table)
      - `designer_id` (uuid, foreign key to designers table)
      - `design_file_url` (text) - Supabase Storage URL for .sh3d file
      - `preview_image_url` (text) - Preview image URL
      - `version` (integer) - Design version number
      - `notes` (text) - Designer notes about the design
      - `customer_feedback` (text) - Customer feedback on design
      - `status` (text) - draft, submitted, approved, revision_requested
      - `created_at` (timestamptz)
      - `updated_at` (timestamptz)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `project_designs` table
    - Designers can create, read, update their own designs
    - Customers can view designs for their projects
    - Admins can view all designs

  3. Storage
    - Create storage bucket for design files
