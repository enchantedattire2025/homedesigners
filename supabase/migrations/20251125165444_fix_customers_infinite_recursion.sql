  # Fix Infinite Recursion in customers RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - "Designers can view assigned projects" policy queries designers table
    - "Designers can view customer projects" policy queries both project_shares and designers
    - These designer table queries can trigger admin checks creating circular dependencies
    - When checking customers access, it checks designers, which checks admin_users

  2. Solution
    - Create SECURITY DEFINER helper functions that bypass RLS
    - These functions will check designer status without triggering RLS policies
    - Replace the subqueries in customers policies with these helper functions

  3. Changes
    - Create helper functions: is_assigned_designer() and has_project_share()
    - Update customers table policies to use these functions
